Aim of this grafical progect is render simple fractal-drawings such as Mandelbrot, Julia and another pretty ones. User is able to
zoom in and out images freely, move canvas by arrows - and every frame should be recalculated.

And also, in my variation of programm you can call "Shooting stars" meme-mode - and have fun!

And more depressive variation of meme-man's trip (with Simon's and Garfunkel's "The Sound of Silence" track):

So, I hope you'll enjoy playing with this miniature. You can start the programm like this lol:
